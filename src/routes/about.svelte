<Header pageTitle="About" />
<p>
	I'm an ambitious self-taught Web Developer. I specialize in frontend development and love creating
	great user interactions and things for the web.
</p>
<p>
	I started my self-taught web development journey when I built my first website over ten years ago
	- a photography portfolio. So much has changed since then. To find out if I still enjoyed web
	development, I took part in Udacity's Google Developer Challenge Scholarship which I finished and
	then was given a chance to take part in the full Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship, which I
	successfully completed.
</p>
<p>
	Since then I have not looked back and continue honing my skills. Generally, I love programming,
	but my passion is in web development and I enjoy using React, Svelte and the latest technologies,
	especially the JAMStack, to build modern websites and apps.
</p>
<p>
	I'm currently a part-time student at The Open University studing towards a BSc in Computing and
	IT.
