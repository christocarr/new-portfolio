<Header pageTitle="About" />
<p>
	I'm an ambitious self-taught Web Developer. I specialize in frontend development and love creating
	great user interfaces and things for the web.
</p>
<p>
	I started my web development journey when I built my first website over ten years ago - a
	photography portfolio. So much has changed in the development world since then and to find out if
	I still enjoyed web development, I took part in Udacity's Google Developer Challenge Scholarship
	which I completed and then was given a chance to take part in the full Google Developer Nanodegree
	Scholarship, which I successfully completed.
</p>
<p>
	Since then I have not looked back and continue honing my dev skills. Generally, I enjoy
	programming and enjoy learning programming languages like Java, Python and C#. But what really
	fuels the fire is web development and I love using React, Svelte and especially the <a

	>, to build modern websites and apps.
</p>
<p>
	During my past employment in the railway industry I was involved in maintaining and upgrading the
	railway infrustructure for London Underground and Network Rail. Taking my passion for web
	development to the next level I have been striving towards a career change as a Frontend Developer
	and hope to share my passion and knowledge in a collaborative enviroment where the software we
	build will be used by millions of satisfied users.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, I am a part-time student at The Open University studing towards a BSc in Computing and
	IT.
